        <h3>My name is Eva and welcome to my webpage! I've coded this all myself with very minimal help from AI!</h3>

        <p>For a more professional introduction I am currently studying Graphic Design and Human Resource Management. I am a junior at the University 
            of Minnesota Duluth. I am building this website as part of my MIS class but I also have an interest in basic code and website designing so this has been 
            interesting for me. You can find out more about my experience at UMD on the <a href="discover.html">Discover UMD</a> page.
        </p>
        <p>I love to ski and dance and go on adventures outdoors! I have seven years of ski racing under my belt
            and have been on a pair of skis as long as I can remember. I also love to dance and have been dancing for fifteen years.
             I also have been going on family vacation hikes to state and national parks since I was a kid, so being outside is a big part of my life.
              You can find out more about my hobbies and interests on the <a href="hobbies.html">Hobbies</a> page!
