        <!-- Page-specific content -->
         <p>I did PSEO in the last two years of highschool and graduated with my Associates Degree. I then thought about where I wanted to go after that, and 
            I ended up going to Mankato State University for a year. I didn't love it there, so I transferred to UMD. I was already familiar with it since I had lived
             about an hour away durng my childhood. I love the campus and the surrounding area, especially the lake and the hiking trails.
         </p>
         <p>...</p>
         <p>I love that Duluth feels like my home up north, but also different enough to be fresh. I enjoy both the woods and the lake. Duluth is a nice mix of a bigger 
            city but seeming like a small town in a way.
         </p>
         <p>...</p>
         
         <p>So far I've been to a few of the musicals and plays here such as Cabaret and Anne of Green Gables which I really enjoyed! I am also on the Alpine Ski Team, which 
            I enjoy. I love skiing and being outside in the winter so that was an obvious choice for me. Another club I am a part of is Bulldog Rocketry. I am not a STEM major, but I 
            enjoy being around people who are authentic and passionate about what they do. My friend and I are on the marketing and design portion of the club, and designed the sweatshirt 
            design for this year which was really fun.
