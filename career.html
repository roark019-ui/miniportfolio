        <!-- Page-specific content -->
         <p>From the business fair on campus that I went to, there wasn't a company looking for a designer. However, there were a couple that were open to an HR Minor student. 
            The two companies that interested me the most were Target and Marices. Target is a corporation that has a lot of posiions open frequently and I could 
            work my way up. Maurices's headquarters are in Duluth so I could potentially work there since I do enjoy Duluth. Maurices is a clothing compay tha had broad reach 
            but the company culture was more of a small business which I liked. Both companies had good benefits and seemed to value their employees.
         </p>
         <p>Target and Maurices' both are bigger companies that didn't really have contact information to give out. 
            They both had websites where I could apply for jobs and internships online rather that contact information for a specific person.
         </p>
         <p>Detailed explanation of why you like that job/internship opportunity. I think working for a bigger corporation could get my name out there in a way, and it would be 
            interesting to see the differences between bigger corporations vs small businesses in the way they work and the environment in the workplace. I think Maurices would 
            be more my speed.</p>
         <p>As of currently, I am not qualified for the positions as I do not have my HR minor yet, but I think I could be a good asset to a team as I am friendly, I like to work with people, 
            and I like to help others and guide otherd to success. For a design position, I have some experience with graphic design through my coursework, a previous internship, and personal 
            projects but I still need to build up my portfolio a bit more to be competitive.
         </p>
         <p>My skills and interest could align with these companies because I love working with people and I enjoy collaborating on projects. I like helping people succeed and find their stride. 
            I also have some skills in graphic design that could be useful for marketing or other design related tasks. I will gain experience and knowledge of more HR related topics as I finish 
            my minor that will help me be more qualified for these positions in the future.
